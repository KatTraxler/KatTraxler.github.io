:wave: 
I am a Security Professional based in the Twin Cities performing penetration testing, security architecture and research in the areas of Web Security, IAM, Payment Technologies and Cloud Native Technologies.  

My research reflects my obsessions.
The attack surface at the confluence of Identity and Cloud Platforms whispers to me in my sleep and keeps me up at night.
