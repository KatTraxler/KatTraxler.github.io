**Leverage The DeRF for attacker simulations, validating security controls or enhancing cloud detection capabilities**<br>

DeRF (Detection Replay Framework) is an "Attacks As A Service" framework, allowing the emulation of offensive techniques and generation of repeatable detection samples in the cloud. Built on Google Workflows

The DeRF is open-source tool available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vectra-ai-research/derf), consisting of Terraform modules and a Cloud Run application. Within this package, a variety of built-in attack techniques are provided, focusing on AWS and GCP. The DeRF is shipped with attack technique parity with Stratus Red Team to help eliminate the need for operators to choose tooling-based attack capabilities.
