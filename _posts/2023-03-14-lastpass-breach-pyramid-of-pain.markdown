Mining LastPass communications for new cloud IOCs<br>

In this blog published in the [Vectra AI Research](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/lastpass-breach-the-pyramid-of-pain-perspective) space, each piece of LastPass communications is dissected for new pieces of intel and indicators are evaluated against the pyramind of pain model.     

In my evaluation of publicly available intel, I follow closely the advice given by author of the Pyramid of Pain, David Bianco’s “Whenever you receive new intel on an adversary (whether it be APT1/Comment Crew or any other threat actor), review it carefully against the Pyramid of Pain. For every paragraph, ask yourself ‘Is there anything here I can use to detect the adversary's activity, and where does this fall on the pyramid?’”
