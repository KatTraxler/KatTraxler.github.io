**How to exploit Log4J software vulnerabilities in cloud-hosted VMs for maximum impact*<br>

Want to understand how the Log4J vulnerability uniquely impacts cloud environments?  Read my blog hosted in the [Vectra AI Research](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/log4j-unique-impact-in-the-cloud) site for details on how the Log4J vulnerability is exploited and why responders need to take addition measures to rotate credentials when vulnerable code is deployed on cloud-hosted VMs.  

As additional resources, refer to my [Github Repo](https://github.com/vectra-ai-research/log4j-aws-sandbox) which includes a terraform deployment for a log4J testing sandbox complete with vulnerable application and JNDI Exploit Server.
