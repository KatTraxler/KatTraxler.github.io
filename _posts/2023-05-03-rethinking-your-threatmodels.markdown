**The cloud scrambled context for defenders who are accustomed to leaning on their understanding  of traditional on-prem architecture**<br>

In this [post](https://www.vectra.ai/blogpost/rethinking-your-threat-models-for-the-cloud) I aim to clarify the unique approaches needed to defend cloud systems by discussing the architecture underpinning the cloud, the resulting threat model, and finally, how attackers abuse such systems.     

The post first starts with a brief review of classic on-prem architecture and the inflection points attackers seek to exploit. Juxtaposing against a traditional tech stack is the architecture of your cloud service provider (CSP). Following this, I walk through the basics of cloud architecture, the new threat model that emerges and consequently, the steps attackers take to infiltrate cloud deployed resources. To wrap things up, once we are on firm ground as to why the cloud is different, I highlight a cloud-native way in which attackers abuse the environment along with how defenders need to think about visibility in the cloud.
