I"˜<p>This GCPâ€™s model for managing access to resources has three main parts: <strong>Who, What Role and the Resource.</strong></p>

<p>To grant permissions in GCP, you combine the <strong>WHO</strong> and the <strong>WHAT</strong> to create a policy.  You apply this policy, or Bind the Role to a Resource to create scope.</p>

<p><strong>Who</strong>: Member in Policies. Users and Groups are managed in GSuite (Google Workspace), while Service Accounts and the Identity Namespace are wholly constructs of the Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p><strong>What Role</strong>: A role is a collection of permissions. Permissions determine what actions you can take on a resource. When a role is assigned to a member, you grant all the permissions that the role contains.</p>

<p><strong>Resource</strong>: Who, has What Role is applied to a Resource to affect IAM Policy. A Member is assigned a Role which is then bound to a Resource to create an IAM policy.
In GCP, Each Node of the Organizational Hierarchy is a Resource which can have IAM Policy Bound.  This includes the Organizational Node, Folder and Project Nodes, in addition to all Resources contained within a Project.</p>
