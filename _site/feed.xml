        <title>GCP Users and Group 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Users and Groups are two types of identities which can be assigned IAM Roles in GCP.  When Users and Groups are members in IAM Policy, they are referenced by their email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no directory in GCP containing Users or Groups.  Instead, Users and Groups live in your the GSuite directory for your registered Google Domain. 
An inventory of the Users and Groups in your domain is found in their own console,  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin.google.com/ac/users &lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a console completely apart from the GCP Cloud Console, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;console.cloud.google.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GCP, you can assign Roles directly to Users however, this pattern is bound to face management and scalability problems.  Instead, consider placing Users in Groups and assigning GCP IAM Roles to the Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defaults:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- **ANY** Google User or Group in **ANY** domain can be assigned IAM Roles in **ANY** Organization or Project in any domain.
	* Example: The GCP Organization for ` test.com ` is not limited to only having IAM Roles assigned to Users and Groups with ` test.com ` email addresses.
	* To limit WHO can have IAM Roles in your GCP Organization, employ the Organizational Policy Constraint `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` where by you can whitelist allowed domains.
	
- If you have a GCP Organization associated to your GSuite Directory, all Users in your Directory can create Projects and configure billing by default.  These permissions are automatically inherited and need to be explicitly disabled in GCP at the Organization level.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>GCP Service Account 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Service Accounts are non-human identities used for Infrastructure and Resources.  Service Accounts do not have passwords.  You can optionally generate and export a Private Key for a Service Account. But you’ll only want to do this when you need to enable an external integrations, that is, authenticated API calls to your Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Service Account is &lt;strong&gt;Both&lt;/strong&gt; an Identity and a Resource.&lt;br /&gt;
This might be the most difficult concept in GCP to initially grasp. Let me help break that down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Accounts as Resources&lt;/strong&gt;
Service Accounts are created and reside within a Project.  &lt;em&gt;You can think of a Service Account as having a ‘home’ Project.&lt;/em&gt;  Just like a Compute Instance or a Storage Bucket ‘resides’ in a Project where its direct parent in the Resource Hierarchy is a Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a Resource, you can &lt;em&gt;setIAMPolicy&lt;/em&gt; on a Service Account.  IAM on a Service Account include permissions like:
	* who can impersonate that Service Account
	* who can ActAs the Service Account
	* who can generate keys for the Service Account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Accounts as Identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other types of Identities in GCP (i.e. Users and Groups), Service Accounts can have IAM Policy bindings at any node of the Resource Hierarchy.  Just because a Service Account lives in a Project, doesn’t mean it needs any permissions in that Project.  A Service Account can be assigned any Role, which can be applied at any node of the Resource Hierarchy, just like a User or Group.
When setting IAM Policy &lt;em&gt;ON&lt;/em&gt; a Service Account, the WHO can be another Service Account! In fact, It might be a desirable pattern to have a Service Account, having permissions allowing it to impersonate another Service Account.
In this case, the Service Account doing the impersonating is the &lt;em&gt;WHO&lt;/em&gt;, and is acting like an identity. While the Service Account being impersonated is the &lt;em&gt;Resource.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GCP Resource Hierarchy 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Resources in Google Cloud are organized into a hierarchy with each level or node of this structure being called a Resource.  At the top of the hierarchy is the &lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt; followed by any number of nested &lt;strong&gt;Folders&lt;/strong&gt; which then house &lt;strong&gt;Projects&lt;/strong&gt;. At the lowest level of the hierarchy are the widgets the compose a GCP Project, things like a Pub/Sub topic, Cloud Compute instance or Cloud Buckets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the Resource you are referring to is a Project, a Folder or a Key Ring, each resource has exactly one parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three characteristics of a GCP resource hierarchy to consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resource ownership for Lifecycle management:  If you delete a Project, you delete all Resources contained within the Project. If a Folder is deleted, all Folders or Projects that inherit from it are deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources serve as attachment points for IAM Policy and Organizational Policies.  IAM Policy can be bound at any node in the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resource hierarchy didcates how IAM Policy inheritance will affect access control. IAM Policy both applies to the resouce which it was attached, and all direct children. In GCP there is no concept of overriding IAM Policy inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GCP IAM Policy 101</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This GCP’s model for managing access to resources has three main parts: &lt;strong&gt;Who, What Role and the Resource.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grant permissions in GCP, you combine the &lt;strong&gt;WHO&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;WHAT&lt;/strong&gt; to create a policy.  You apply this policy, or Bind the Role to a Resource to create scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt;: Member in Policies. Users and Groups are managed in GSuite (Google Workspace), while Service Accounts and the Identity Namespace are wholly constructs of the Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Role&lt;/strong&gt;: A role is a collection of permissions. Permissions determine what actions you can take on a resource. When a role is assigned to a member, you grant all the permissions that the role contains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource&lt;/strong&gt;: Who, has What Role is applied to a Resource to affect IAM Policy. A Member is assigned a Role which is then bound to a Resource to create an IAM policy.
In GCP, Each Node of the Organizational Hierarchy is a Resource which can have IAM Policy Bound.  This includes the Organizational Node, Folder and Project Nodes, in addition to all Resources contained within a Project.&lt;/p&gt;
